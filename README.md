# i3wm-configs
my configs for the i3 window manager

**instructions (at least for ubuntu 16.04):**

The following applications are used in addition to i3:
  
  * *conky* (`sudo apt install conky`) for the i3bar-stuff
  * *udiskie* (`sudo apt install udiskie`) for USB-mounts
  * *redshift* (`sudo apt install redshift`) for color adjustments.

**installation:**

  * copy *config* into ~/.config/i3/
  * copy *conkyrc* into ~/.config/conky/
  * copy *conky-i3bar* and *update-check* in a directory that's included in $PATH (I use ~/bin/)
